# Welcome to Wireless Ad Hoc Federated Learning
This space provides the code for Wireless Ad Hoc Federated Learning (WAFL) -- A Fully Autonomous Collaborative Learning with Device-to-Device Communication.

As of Aug 2024, this repository contains the following two projects.
1. [WAFL-MLP](./WAFL-MLP/): The most basic codes with a fully-connected neural network for starters. You can learn what the WAFL is.
2. [WAFL-ViT](./WAFL-ViT/): WAFL with Vision Transformer for image recognition.
