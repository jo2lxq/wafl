# WAFL
Code Space for Wireless Ad Hoc Federated Learning (WAFL) -- A Fully Autonomous Collaborative Learning with Device-to-Device Communication

This repository contains two projects.
1. WAFL: The most basic codes with a fully-connected neural network for starters. You can learn what the WAFL is.
2. WAFL-ViT: WAFL with Vision Transformer for image recognition.
